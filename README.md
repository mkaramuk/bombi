# Bombi
Bombi is a very simple [bomberman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomberman) implementation written in C++/SDL2. It aims to create a multiplayer bomberman game using sockets. But first of all, its purpose is to learn socket and SDL2 programming.

# Compile
I'll write a detailed documentation. But until that time, you have install SDL2 and SDL2_image libraries to compile Bombi. After install those libraries, just type in terminal:

```shell
make
```
> I assumed, you are on a Linux system.

It compiles Bombi and create an executable file at the root of the repository.
